# DSA--Visualizer
To build this DSA Visualizer, we need to strip away the abstractions and show the "naked" memory.

## Most people learn Data Structures by memorizing code.

But computers don’t execute code.
They execute memory operations.

So I started building something different.

### 📘 DSA Internals  
Don’t memorize algorithms. Visualize the machine.

It’s an interactive journey through how data structures actually live and behave in memory:

### Level 1 – The Foundation  
Arrays vs Linked Lists — not as diagrams, but as raw RAM.  
See why arrays are fast and why linked lists are scattered.

### Level 2 – Abstraction  
Stacks & Queues — not “things”, but behaviors.  
Switch between array and linked list implementations and watch what really changes.

### Level 3 – Hierarchy  
Trees & Heaps — how do you fit a pyramid into a flat array?  
Visualize the structure and the math behind it.

### Level 4 – Lookup  
Hash Tables — the illusion of O(1).  
Watch keys turn into addresses and collisions handled in real time.

### Level 5 – Connections  
Graphs (BFS & DFS) — draw your own network.  
See the ripple of BFS and the pathfinding nature of DFS.

This isn’t a course.
No shortcuts. No memorization.

Just clear mental models of how machines work underneath abstractions.

Still building. Still learning.
Feedback from engineers and students is welcome.
